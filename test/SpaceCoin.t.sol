    * The problem with my previous attempt was that I didn't realize the transfer function in the SpaceCoin contract was being called by the coinCreator address, which doesn't have any SpaceCoin balance. Therefore, the transfer function was reverting due to an underflow error when trying to subtract the transfer amount and tax from the coinCreator's balance. To fix this, I need to make the transfer call in the test_transfer_SuccessfulTransfer function come from an address that has a SpaceCoin balance. The coinCreator address has a balance of SpaceCoins, so I will make the transfer call come from the coinCreator address.
